# Web 3D Editor Architecture Design - Conceptual Overview

## Critical Issue: React-Compatible Data Structures

**The Problem**: Traditional class-based mesh systems (like half-edge data structures) don't integrate well with React's reactive paradigm. React needs serializable, immutable data that triggers re-renders when changed.

**The Solution**: All geometry and scene data must be stored as plain JavaScript objects/arrays in Zustand stores, making them fully reactive and compatible with React's render cycle.

## Core Module Structure

### 1. Data Layer - Reactive Geometry System

#### Geometry Data Structure
Instead of class-based half-edge meshes, use plain object representations stored in Zustand:
- Vertices, edges, and faces as arrays of plain objects
- Each element has unique IDs for React key props
- All data is serializable and can trigger React re-renders
- Geometry operations return new immutable data structures

#### State Management Architecture
Multiple specialized Zustand stores that React components can subscribe to:
- **Scene Store**: Scene hierarchy, object properties, transformations
- **Geometry Store**: All mesh data as plain objects, with computed properties
- **Selection Store**: Currently selected elements, selection modes
- **Viewport Store**: Camera state, shading modes, UI preferences
- **Animation Store**: Keyframes, timeline state, playback controls
- **Transform Store**: Active transformations, gizmo states

Each store uses immer for immutable updates and includes computed selectors for derived data.

### 2. React Three Fiber Integration Layer

#### Custom R3F Components
Components that bridge between reactive data and Three.js objects:
- **ReactiveGeometry**: Subscribes to geometry store, rebuilds Three.js geometry on changes
- **SelectionRenderer**: Visualizes selected vertices/edges/faces based on selection store
- **AnimatedMesh**: Applies keyframe animations using Three.js animation system
- **TransformGizmo**: Interactive transformation controls that update stores

#### Geometry Conversion System
Pure functions that convert between data representations:
- Quad-to-triangle conversion for rendering
- Three.js BufferGeometry generation from store data
- UV mapping and normal calculation
- LOD generation for performance

### 3. Editor Logic Layer

#### Tool System
React hooks that manage editor tools:
- Each tool is a custom hook that subscribes to relevant stores
- Tools update stores through actions, triggering React re-renders
- State machines for complex tool interactions
- Keyboard and mouse event handling through React patterns

#### Operation System
Immutable operation pattern for undo/redo:
- Each operation describes state changes as data transformations
- Operations are stored as serializable objects
- Undo/redo by applying inverse transformations
- Command pattern implemented with pure functions

### 4. Animation System Integration

#### Keyframe Management
Animation data stored in reactive format:
- Keyframes as arrays of plain objects in animation store
- Three.js AnimationClips generated reactively from store data
- Timeline scrubbing updates store state, triggering re-renders
- Real-time preview through store subscriptions

### 5. UI Components

#### Panel Components
Standard React components that subscribe to stores:
- Scene hierarchy renders from scene store data
- Properties panels bind to selected object data
- Timeline component visualizes animation store data
- All updates flow through store actions

## Major Technical Challenges with React-First Approach

### 1. Performance with Large Data Sets
**Challenge**: React re-rendering large geometry data can be expensive
**Approach**: 
- Granular store subscriptions to minimize re-renders
- Memoization of expensive computations
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Selective component updates using React.memo and careful dependency management

### 2. Geometry Data Reactivity
**Challenge**: Converting complex geometry operations to immutable updates
**Approach**:
- Design geometry operations as pure functions returning new state
- Use structural sharing to minimize memory overhead
- Implement efficient diffing for geometry changes
- Batch related updates to prevent cascade re-renders

### 3. Three.js Integration
**Challenge**: Bridging reactive data with imperative Three.js objects
**Approach**:
- Use useEffect hooks to sync store data with Three.js objects
- Implement ref-based access patterns for direct Three.js manipulation
- Create abstraction layer that handles the imperative/reactive boundary
- Careful cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### 4. Selection System Performance
**Challenge**: Real-time selection feedback with reactive data
**Approach**:
- Optimize selection algorithms to work with plain object data
- Use spatial indexing data structures stored in stores
- Implement selection debouncing and throttling
- GPU-based picking with results stored reactively

### 5. Animation Performance
**Challenge**: Smooth animation playback while maintaining reactivity
**Approach**:
- Pre-calculate animation curves and store as optimized data
- Use requestAnimationFrame with store updates for smooth playback
- Implement frame-based batching for animation updates
- Background processing for complex animation calculations

### 6. Memory Management
**Challenge**: Large scenes with reactive data can consume significant memory
**Approach**:
- Implement lazy loading patterns for geometry data
- Use weak references where appropriate
- Garbage collection optimization through careful store design
- Progressive data loading for complex scenes

## Data Flow Architecture

### Unidirectional Data Flow
All changes flow through the store system:
1. User interactions trigger store actions
2. Store actions update state immutably
3. React components re-render based on subscriptions
4. Three.js objects update through useEffect hooks
5. Visual feedback completes the cycle

### Store Synchronization
Stores communicate through:
- Cross-store subscriptions for related data
- Event system for complex interactions
- Computed selectors that derive data from multiple stores
- Batched updates to prevent circular dependencies

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Reactive Foundation
Establish the reactive data architecture and prove it can handle basic geometry operations without performance issues.

### Phase 2: Editor Tools
Build selection and transformation tools that work entirely through the reactive system.

### Phase 3: Advanced Geometry
Implement complex modeling operations using the reactive approach, ensuring all intermediate states are renderable.

### Phase 4: Animation Integration
Add the animation system while maintaining full reactivity for all animated properties.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### React-First Approach
Everything must be reactive and renderable by React. No imperative systems that bypass the React render cycle.

### Immutable Data Structures
All geometry and scene data stored as immutable structures that can trigger React re-renders reliably.

### Store-Centric Architecture
Zustand stores are the single source of truth. Components are pure views of store state.

### Performance Through Selectivity
Rather than avoiding React re-renders, optimize which components re-render and when through careful store design.

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk: Performance
Reactive geometry data for large scenes could cause performance issues. Mitigation through careful optimization and profiling.

### Medium Risk: Complexity
The reactive approach adds complexity to geometry operations. Mitigation through good abstractions and testing.

### Low Risk: React Integration
This approach naturally integrates with React, reducing integration risks.

This architecture ensures everything remains reactive and renderable by React while still providing the advanced geometry editing capabilities you need. The key insight is that the data structures themselves must be React-native, not just the UI components.
