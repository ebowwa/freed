Context: I want to build a 3D Editor, similar to Blender, for the web. I am mainly interested in having a subset of it, such as the Edit Tool to modify Objects and animations with keyframes.
Goal: Design a solid architecture for my editor.
Constraints:
 - Uses react for UI and react three fiber for the 3D rendering
 - Since ThreeJS is triangle based but editors like Blender use quads with half-edge data structures, we need to extend ThreeJS Mesh with that functionality
 - React three fiber is extended with our custom data structure
 - It is using multiple zustand stores to keep everything in the editor in sync
 - The code is testable and maintainable and modular
Functional Requirements:
 - Scene Hierarchy: Displays the full scene tree including all objects
 - Object Mode: Select one or more objects in the scene, move, rotate, scale them
 - Edit Mode: Vertex, Edge, Face selection modes
 - Viewport Shading: Solid, Rendered, Wireframe
 - In Edit Mode, users can drag, rotate, scale the selected pieces
 - - For vertex, rotate and scale have no effect
 - Animation Timeline: All properties of all objects can be set to keyframes for animation purposes
 - Animations use the threejs native animation module
Output:
 - Challenge the technical feasibility of this project
 - Find contradictory requirements or constraints, if there are any
 - If possible, Outline the general module structure as well as a comprehensive overview of technical challenges that need to be addressed
 - Otherwise followup with recommendations on how to change the requirements

Followup as the AI ignored the fact that class based systems do not sync with react UIs and for some reason it decided to give me code:
1. You have not addressed the fact that i want to be able to render everything in react, if i use custom class based system, that won't sync with react, ever, will it?
2. Remove any code from the document, i want just the conceptional part and descriptions
