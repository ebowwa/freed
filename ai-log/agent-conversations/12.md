# Smoothing edit mode
Problem: When a selection is moved, committed and the selection does NOT change, and i move it again, it picks it up from where it was INITIALLY, before the first operation (likely same bug for rotate and scale). 
Expected: It should always start the next (any) operation from the committed last known store state
Context: In edit mode, the vertices, edges and faces can be moved/rotated/scaled.
