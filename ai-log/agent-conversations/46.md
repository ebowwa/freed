# Proper Camera support
Just a quick small vertical to integrate cameras properly into the editor.

## Prompt
Task: Add some proper user (scene) camera handling to the editor.
Additionally integrate all threejs camera settings into the inspector panel. 

State Management:
Put everything that is related to the cameras properties inside the geometry store!

The editor-related state can be in the viewport store, it already holds some camera information.

Notes:
Create a toolbar that sits on the very right, at the top position of the main toolbar i have, where users can switch cameras quickly.

Make it slim and soothing in design.

Write reusable small files, avoid inline hook logic, prefer to write dedicated hook files if needed.

Make sure that when users switch from the default scene camera that has orbitcontrols to connect the r3f orbitcontrols to the now new active camera (r3f has a way to do that!).
