# Tapping into particles
Trying out to get a somewhat usable particle system

## Note on the results
Oh shoot, our codebase is becoming too big to do prompt + followups :( Anyways, i still got some requests left for the next 4 days of the month so it should be fine, even if i have to provide multiple prompts conversations.

## Prompt
Task: Add some particle system to the supported objects

User Interaction:
- Users can tweak the particle system in the inspector panel
- A System has an emitter object (select from scene objects)
- A System has a particle object (select from current scene objects)

Emitter Properties:
- position is inferred from the systems transform, so no extra panel config needed
- object: scene object reference
- emission rate: amount of particles spawned per frame in the animation timeline
- direction: vector 3 input (use just like the transform properties a XYZ input with drag inputs)
- velocity: vector 3 input

Particle Properties:
- Lifetime measured in frames
- Min Scale
- Max Scale
- Angular Velocity (vector 3)

Physical Behavior for the System:
- Gravity: Vector 3
- Wind: Vector 3

Integrate the Particle System stepping with the animation system i have!
