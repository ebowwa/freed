# Revisiting code structure and performance
The core features work. Good - so far we don't know how it scales and if advanced features will be possible, but i think 10 large coding prompts are probably a good moment to revisit the overall structure and do some vibe cleaning and refactoring.

Current Architecture: A client side nextjs app with zustand stores for global state management
Pain Points: Many components have become bigger, there is no proper colocated folder structure (everything sits in a components folder)
Business Requirements:
- consistent kebab-case for file names
- 
Technical Goals: [Improvements in maintainability, performance, scalability]
Team Context: [Team size, skill levels, timeline]
