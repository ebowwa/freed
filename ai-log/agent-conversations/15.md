# Adding the properties panel on the right side

So far so good, we've got a basic 3d editor with advanced editing features, but we're still missing a lot of the things that allow us to modify the scene, such as the properties panel that editor like blender have.

Task: Add a floating properties panel to the right side. It should have a tab bar on the top (which is horizontally scrollable) that allows to switch between different properties panels (for now leave all of them empty except the inspector panel).

Panels: 
 - Object Inspector: Displays properties for the selected object, including transform data (location, rotation, scale), visibility, and instancing options.

 - Scene Properties: Contains settings for the overall scene, such as units, gravity, and scene-wide options like render engines or view layer settings.

 - View Layer: Manages view layer settings, including layer visibility, render passes, and compositing options.

 - World: Controls the environment settings, such as background lighting, environment textures, and world shaders.

 - Object Modifiers: Manages modifiers applied to the selected object, like Subdivision Surface, Mirror, or Array.

 - Object Data Properties: Object Data Properties (icon: varies based on object type, e.g., mesh, curve, or light)
Contains settings specific to the objectâ€™s data type (e.g., mesh vertices, curve settings, or light properties).

 - Material: Manages material settings for the selected object, including shader nodes, textures, and surface properties.

 - Render Properties: Contains settings for rendering, including resolution, sampling, and output options

 - Output: Manages output settings, such as file format, resolution, and output path for renders.

State Management:
- as always, everything flows as much as possible through the zustand stores!

Notes:
 - Make sure to provide a robust foundation by splitting the code feature wise in a hierarchical folder layout. Write small focused react components instead of big all-in-one files.

 - The renderer is threejs, so most properties will align with whatever threejs allows
