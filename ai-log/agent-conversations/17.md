# Vertical 1: Scene Hierarchy
We've got most of the basic functionality as well as some advanced editing tools, now it's time to dive into some of the verticals to ensure they work properly and smoothly

This will blow quite a few prompts but it's good at this stage to not mix up the context with horizontal features.

## Prompt
Task: Implement a proper and full scene hierarchy panel.
User Interactions:
- On the top of the panel should be a search, which filters the objects
- Hierarchy: Users should be able to group nodes in groups (called collections/folders in blender)
- Select multiple by holding shift and clicking nodes (toggle select/unselect)
- Selecting a group selects all nodes in it's subhierarchy
- Locking / Unlocking
- View / Hide
- Camera / No Camera (Part of final render or not)
- Delete
- Copy
- Paste
- Cut
Rendering:
- Some features such as view/hide, locking, camera should be visible when the node is hovered (and clickable)
- All others and the above are available via a context menu on right click, you may use base-ui for context menus, it is already installed
