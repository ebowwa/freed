# Exploring advanced features
So we've got a refactored and working implementation of object and edit modes. Now we'll try to tap into advanced editing features such as loop cuts.

## Move Tool
* Purpose: Translates selected geometry.
* Shortcut: `G`.
* Description: Activates a gizmo to move selected vertices, edges, or faces along X, Y, or Z axes. Press `X`, `Y`, or `Z` during the operation to constrain to an axis.

## Rotate Tool
* Purpose: Rotates selected geometry.
* Shortcut: `R`.
* Description: Rotates selected components around a pivot point (e.g., 3D Cursor or selection center). Use `X`, `Y`, or `Z` to constrain rotation to an axis.

## Scale Tool
* Purpose: Scales selected geometry.
* Shortcut: `S`.
* Description: Resizes selected vertices, edges, or faces. Use `X`, `Y`, or `Z` to scale along specific axes or press `Shift` to exclude an axis.

## Extrude Tool
* Purpose: Creates new geometry by extending selected components.
* Shortcut: `E` (or `Alt+E` for advanced options).
* Description: Pulls selected vertices, edges, or faces to create new geometry. For example, extruding a face creates a connected face. Use `Alt+E` for options like Extrude Along Normals.

## Inset Tool
* Purpose: Creates new faces inside selected faces.
* Shortcut: `I`.
* Description: Offsets the edges of selected faces inward or outward, creating new faces. Adjust thickness and depth via the on-screen slider or numeric input.

## Bevel Tool
* Purpose: Rounds or chamfers edges or vertices.
* Shortcut: `Ctrl+B` (edges), `Ctrl+Shift+B` (vertices).
* Description: Adds new geometry to smooth or chamfer edges/vertices. Adjust the width and number of segments with mouse movement or numeric input.

## Loop Cut Tool
* Purpose: Adds edge loops to a mesh.
* Shortcut: `Ctrl+R`.
* Description: Creates a new edge loop that follows the mesh topology. Hover over an edge, click to place the loop, and scroll to add multiple loops. Adjust position with the mouse or numeric input.
