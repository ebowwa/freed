# Textures
Oh god.. I've avoided this for so long, as the integration can quickly become much more complex than one thinks - especially given that at some point i want to allow users to import from other 3d files (gltf, fbx etc.)
Additionally it has to be compatible with the shader node system.. Yea, let's just try, because why not?

## Prompt

Task: Add texture support to the shader node materials.

Read up on TSL if you don't know it fully:
https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language

User Interactions:
 - Users can drag images to texture nodes
 - or they can click a field on that node to open file picker
 - that is stored locally and will also be saved with the correct file name in the /assets/ folder of the t3d file
 - they can connect these textures as inputs where tsl allows textures
 
 State Management:
 - Same way as every other node
 - The texture data (file) itself is not stored in zustand, have a global files store that will be used to hold the files as well as their metadata (for saving them on t3d files)

Rendering:
 - The changes in a material in the node editor are directly reflected in the meshes that have that material attached to them
 - Textures are used efficiently

Notes:
- Make sure to efficiently store, retrieve and save the texture files. Again, this will work all locally and if a user for example uploads the same file twice just store that once
