# Quick addition for usability
small, unstructured prompt to improve usability

## Prompt
Add copy paste for nodes to the shader editor (except input and output nodes). Make sure it doesn't interfere with the copy-paste of the 3d editor canvas!
Also nodes are deleted with backspace, objects in the scene with del

Both should be backspace AND del, however these should also not interfere with each other. If the shader editor is in focus, these commands are only valid there, if the focus is literally on the 3d canvas itself, then there.
