# Fun with particles
I want to test something out and i think it's going to be quite fun - and maybe even useful for some people, if we had this?

## Prompt
Task: Add new phyisics objects to the 3d editor
Objects:
- Attractor attracts things around it, like a gravity field
- Repulsor.. repulses things in it's influence zone
- Vortex: The Vortex force field gives a spiraling force that twists the direction of points around the force objectâ€™s local Z axis. This can be useful for making a swirling sink, or tornado, or kinks in particle

Rendering In Wireframe/Solid shader mode:
- Attractor is shown as a low poly wireframe sphere that shows it's influence radius
- Repulsors same
- Vortex is shown as vortex curves with an arrow line that points up

Rendering in Material shader mode:
- None, invisible all of them

Animation:
- Particles in particle systems interact with these force fields. They are attracted/repulsed etc. by the fields.

Settings:
- In the Inspector panel users can set various values for attractors, repulsors, vortex
