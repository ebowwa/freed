# Fixing the Messy Tool implementations

```Result: GPT-5 delivered a solid result. It fixed most of the unfinished work of sonnet 4 and built a solid editing experience```

Problem: The tool integration is mostly incorrect, vertices are not rendered at all, faces are rendered but not selectable, edges are.. selectable but it is always selecting the wrong edge from where i click?
Additionally none, NONE of the operations can be triggered by hotkeys, AT ALL, i press G / R / S and nothing happens

Expected: The following is the original requirement document:
```requirements
Task: Build the core features of the edit mode
User Interactions:
- in Vertex mode, users can only select vertices
- in Edge mode, users can only select edges
- in Face mode, users can only select faces
- In any case, for any selection, there are three tools available: Move, Rotate, Scale
- Shortcuts: G for move, R for rotate, S for scale
- The Tools do NOT show the threejs rotate/scale/translate gizmos, but instead just like blender, allow users to:
 - when G/R/S is pressed, operation starts, we lock the pointer capture to allow for infinite cursor movement,
 - during operation, if users press X/Y/Z, it toggles axis lock, locking the movement/rotation/scale to that axis only, can be unlocked by pressing again (or any other XYZ)
 - pressing the left mouse button commits the operation
 - pressing ESC aborts the operation, turning everything back to pre-start state (from the store)
State Management:
- Always go through the zustand store, write efficient selectors
- If it not already exists, the tools (move, rotate, scale) should also live in a zustand store
- For performance reasons, while a selection is moved,rotated,scaled, the store is only updated when the operation ENDS
- The move/rotate/scale operations hold a local copy of the selected data which is modified during operation, committed to the store on completion
Rendering:
- Show small black cubes as vertices, that are always, ALWAYS the same size regardless of camera distance to object
- Show black lines for edges
- show grey faces for faces
- If any selection happens on any of these, make them in the iconic blender orange
Notes:
- Regardless of the selection mode (vertex, edge, face), the edges are **always** visible, though only selectable during edge mode.
- use mesh instancing from r3f whenever possible to reduce the computation load, if this blows up the complexity, ignore it for now.
- Write small reusable maintainable files. Prefer always to write smaller colocated files over pushing everything into one file, especially for react components
```

----------

I'll scan the edit-mode components and related stores to pinpoint why rendering, selection, and hotkeys are failing, then implement targeted fixes.

Read EditModeOverlay.tsx

Read VertexRenderer.tsx

Read EdgeRenderer.tsx

Read FaceRenderer.tsx

Read selectionStore.ts

Read ToolHandler.tsx

Read toolOperations.ts

Read ShortcutProvider.tsx

Read TopToolbar.tsx

Read EditorViewport.tsx

Read geometry.ts

Read layout.tsx

Read sceneStore.ts

I'll update the renderers to fix geometry attachment and constant screen-size vertex scaling, and configure the canvas raycaster for better edge picking; then I'll validate for type errors.

I’ll debug the edit-mode rendering, selection, and hotkeys, then implement targeted fixes so vertices render, faces are selectable, edges pick correctly, and G/R/S work.

Checklist

Vertices render with constant on-screen size and selectable in vertex mode
Edges always visible and correctly pick the clicked edge in edge mode
Faces visible and selectable in face mode
Base mesh stops intercepting events in edit mode
G/R/S start Move/Rotate/Scale; X/Y/Z toggle axis; LMB commit; ESC abort
Store only updates on commit; preview uses local copy during operation
actions taken

Client components: Marked all edit-mode components as client so hooks/events mount.
EditModeOverlay.tsx, VertexRenderer.tsx, EdgeRenderer.tsx, FaceRenderer.tsx, ToolHandler.tsx
Vertex rendering (constant pixel size, visible over faces, clickable):
VertexRenderer.tsx: Compute world scale from camera/viewport so cubes are constant-sized; material depthTest/write disabled; merge local vertex overrides with mesh vertices so all vertices render while moving; only stop event propagation in vertex mode.
Edge rendering and picking:
EdgeRenderer.tsx: Attach geometry via bufferGeometry/bufferAttribute for proper raycasting; compute bounding sphere; merge local overrides; only stop propagation in edge mode.
Face rendering and picking:
FaceRenderer.tsx: Attach positions/normals with bufferGeometry/bufferAttribute; material depthWrite disabled; merge local overrides; only stop propagation in face mode.
Prevent base mesh from capturing clicks in edit mode:
EditorViewport.tsx: Set raycast={null} on the object mesh whenever view mode is edit so overlay receives events; added Canvas raycaster thresholds for Line to improve edge picking.
Shortcuts/hotkeys:
ShortcutProvider.tsx: Normalize key handling to lowercase, avoid treating meta as ctrl, ensure document-level handler; hotkeys G/R/S start operations if in edit mode and there’s a selection.
files changed

EditModeOverlay.tsx: client component
VertexRenderer.tsx: constant-size cubes, depth settings, merged local overrides, mode-aware event handling
EdgeRenderer.tsx: correct geometry attachment, improved picking, merged overrides, mode-aware event handling
FaceRenderer.tsx: correct geometry attachment, depth settings, merged overrides, mode-aware event handling
ToolHandler.tsx: client component
EditorViewport.tsx: disable object mesh raycast in edit mode, add raycaster thresholds, fix propagation only in object mode
ShortcutProvider.tsx: normalized key handling
notes on behavior

Vertices: Visible as small black cubes that stay the same size on screen. Selected turn orange.
Edges: Always visible black lines; selected turn orange; picking improved by raycaster thresholds and correct geometry wiring.
Faces: Grey double-sided semitransparent; selected turn orange; selectable in face mode.
Selection: Click handlers only consume events in the corresponding selection mode, so vertices remain clickable even when faces render on top.
Tools: Press G/R/S to start; pointer lock requested; X/Y/Z toggle axis; LMB commits (store updated at end); ESC aborts (reverts preview).
quality gates

Typecheck: PASS (no errors reported in updated files)
Lint: No new issues surfaced by the editor error panel
Build/Run: Not executed here; changes are client-only React and R3F; safe to run.
requirements coverage

Selection by mode: Done
Tools G/R/S with axis lock, commit/abort: Done (ToolHandler + ShortcutProvider)
Store usage and deferred commit: Done (local preview + commit on LMB)
Rendering rules (constant-size vertices, edges always visible, grey faces, orange selected): Done
Performance note (instancing): Deferred; currently simple meshes for clarity
try it

In Object mode: Double-click a mesh to enter Edit mode.
Press 1/2/3 to switch to Vertex/Edge/Face mode.
Click to select (Shift to toggle).
Press G/R/S, move mouse; press X/Y/Z to lock; LMB to commit; ESC to cancel.
small follow-ups (optional)

Add visual axis lock indicator near cursor.
Support numeric input during operation (e.g., type 1.0 for exact move/scale).
Consider InstancedMesh for vertices for perf with many vertices.
If anything still feels off (e.g., pointer lock behavior in your browser), I can add a fallback drag handler that doesn’t require pointer lock.
