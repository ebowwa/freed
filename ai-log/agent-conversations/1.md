geometryActions.getMesh is not a function

src/components/GeometryDebugPanel.tsx (23:34) @ handleCreateCube

21 | const handleCreateCube = () => {
22 | const cubeId = geometryActions.createCube(Math.random() * 2 + 1);

23 | const cube = geometryActions.getMesh(cubeId);
| ^
24 | if (cube) {
25 | sceneActions.createMeshObject(Cube ${Date.now()}, cubeId);
26 | }

I can see the issue. The error is occurring because geometryActions.getMesh doesn't exist. Looking at the geometryStore.ts, there's no getMesh method in the actions, only selector hooks like useMesh.

Let me check what's available in the geometry store and fix this issue:

Read GeometryDebugPanel.tsx, lines 1 to 30

I can see the issue. The code is trying to call geometryActions.getMesh(cubeId) but looking at the geometry store, there's no getMesh action - only selector hooks. The createCube action returns the cube ID, and we can trust that the cube was created successfully.

Let me fix this by removing the unnecessary check since createCube already adds the cube to the store:

GeometryDebugPanel.tsx+1-3
The fix is simple - since the createCube action in the geometry store automatically adds the created cube to the meshes Map and returns its ID, there's no need to check if the cube exists afterward. The cube creation is guaranteed to succeed, so we can directly proceed to create the scene object with the returned cube ID.

The error occurred because:

geometryActions.getMesh doesn't exist as an action in the geometry store
There are only selector hooks like useMesh(meshId) for getting meshes
The check was unnecessary since createCube already ensures the cube is added to the store
Now the code will work correctly without the non-existent method call.
