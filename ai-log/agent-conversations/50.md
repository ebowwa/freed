# Displaying keyframes next to properties
Okay, okay, i know you hate me for another unstructured but i can't help it.. these are just too obvious and the words are so specific i don't think there is much ambiguity anyways?

(Also a sidequest for bugfixes)

## Prompt
Currently the only way to add keyframes is to enable auto keying and move the object around. This has a couple issues and additionally it should be able to do it in the inspector:
- The move/rotate/scale tool in object mode do not work, something is keeping the object locked in place since i introduced the animation timeline
- For move/rotate/scale in object AND edit mode, axis locking (XYZ) no longer work.
- Left to the transform properties in the inspector it should show these keyframe diamonds to allow users to set keyframes at current frame for this property (and unset them when clicked again)
- If the user moves the playhead to a specific frame and that has a keyframe set, the inspector should reflect it by toggling the diamond of that property to active
