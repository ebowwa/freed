# Simplifying shader node system from inspector
I previously had a simple material system and for that use case the inspector was great, which is now more or less useless since the whole system is built from the shader node editor.
Now, hear me out, what if we decide to check for const nodes directly connected to output properties.. and then let users modify the values in the inspector?

Banger if works

## Prompt

Task: Integrate modifiable material output node inputs to the inspector panel.
Context: The inspector panel currently has an incorrect and broken way to modify material properties - it is outdated and any weird attempts to connect them have failed.

How to achieve it:
- If a const node is **directly** connected to the material input, it is editable in the inspector
- If it is not directly a const node, instead of the input in that place show a "open in editor" button
- The logic to modify the const node values should be the same as it is inside the shader node editor
