alightinastorm: I had expected the attractor to be more like a gravity field, like how black holes or planets attract things, the closer they get the stronger the pull etc

the radius of it would kinda be the gravitational max radius?

idk if you understand that but that was what i expected

otherwise what does the attractor do right now? 

change it to be like what i meant and explain to me how it differs from the current impl

GitHub Copilot: I'll update the attractor force to use an inverse-square falloff with a softening term and radius cutoff (gravity-like), in both the real-time and resimulation paths, so behavior is consistent. 
```


Made changes.


```
I’ll switch the attractor to a gravity-like inverse-square force with a soft cutoff by radius and explain the change concisely.

## Checklist
- Explain what the attractor does right now.
- Change it to behave like gravity (stronger when closer, capped by a max radius).
- Explain how the new behavior differs and how to tune it.

## What it did before
- Attractor/repulsor used a linear falloff with distance inside the radius:
  - k = 1 − dist/radius, force ∝ k toward/away from the field center.
  - No effect beyond radius. Strength falls to 0 at the edge, max at the center.
  - This feels “springy” rather than gravitational.

## What it does now (gravity-like)
- Inverse-square falloff inside the radius:
  - Force direction: toward center for “attractor,” away for “repulsor.”
  - Magnitude: strength / (dist^2 + soft^2), with soft = 5% of radius to avoid singularities.
  - No effect beyond radius (radius is the “max influence distance”).
- Applied consistently in both realtime and paused re-simulation paths.

Practical effect:
- Much stronger pull when close, weaker but still present as you approach the center (softening avoids blow-ups).
- At the radius edge, the force is much weaker than a linear falloff but not strictly zero because we clamp by radius, not by an extra taper; it simply stops outside the radius.

Tuning:
- strength now acts like “G·M” (acceleration scale). If it feels too strong near the center, reduce strength or increase radius.
- Acceleration near the radius ≈ strength / (radius^2 + soft^2).

## Actions taken
- Updated particle-system-node.tsx:
  - Replaced linear falloff for attractor/repulsor with inverse-square falloff + softening in both the runtime and re-sim loops.
  - Kept the radius as a hard cutoff (no influence outside).

## Notes
- Vortex keeps its original linear edge taper; attractor/repulsor now use inverse-square.
- Repulsor benefits similarly (inverse-square push).
