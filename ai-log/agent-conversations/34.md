# Modifiers, modifiers, modifiers!!

Well, this time we'll just give it a list of modifiers and hopefully get a good oneshot. I mean, the whole data structure is there already and it can basically just walk through each modifier component step by step (hopefully lol).

there is a 33.5 prompt i didn't include in a separate file because none of you will ever read any of this and the artificial structure i have set up here is just cause i feel like doing it so, yea, here is the 33.5 prompt (it was obviously a very small change and a oneshot)

Context: modifiers.ts
modify this to be a folder and just re-export everything from subfiles (to not break compatibility outside). But in any case each modifier should have it's OWN file
Additionally utils should be in their own file like createDeafultSettings



## Prompt
Task: Add new modifiers to the editor! Make sure they are highly configurable in the panel!

User Interactions:
 - well same as other modifiers!

State Management:
- use the zustand stores for everything as much as possible!
- modifiers should also live like the current ones in the geometry store!

Rendering:
 - same as the others, modifiers are only visible in the render stage unless users "apply" them, where they actually modify the topology and disappear from modifier list

Notes:
 - Make sure to keep everything maintainable, write small modular files and put everything in colocated folders
 - Avoid large inline logic anywhere, even in react components
 - Currently the subdivision settings for example are directly in the modifiers panel, a big NONO! do not do that but instead put the settings of each in their own file. Preferably everything colocated logically
 - If you want to write like a big useeffect logic or similar, it's better to create a hook in a dedicated file for it and pass the params accordingly
 - List of modifiers to implement:
    Array - Creates multiple copies of an object along an axis or based on an offset, with options for relative, constant, or object-based offsets. Useful for repeating geometry like fences or stairs.

    Bevel - Adds beveled edges to a mesh, smoothing sharp edges with customizable width and segments.

    Decimate - Reduces the polygon count of a mesh to optimize it for performance, with options for collapsing edges or planar decimation.

    Edge Split - Splits edges based on an angle threshold or edge selection, useful for controlling shading or preparing models for export.

    Remesh - Reconstructs a mesh into a new topology, often used to create uniform quad-based geometry or voxel-based models.

    Screw - Extrudes a profile along a circular path, creating spiral or lathe-like geometry, such as screws or springs.

    Solidify - Adds thickness to a mesh, useful for creating hollow or solid objects, often for 3D printing or explosions.

    Triangulate - Converts all polygons in a mesh to triangles, often required for game engines or specific rendering workflows. In this case since the rendering layer is threejs it's quite obvious why this might be needed sometimes

    Volume to Mesh - Converts a volume object into a mesh, useful for creating geometry from volumetric data.

    Weld - Merges nearby vertices within a specified distance, cleaning up duplicate or overlapping geometry.
