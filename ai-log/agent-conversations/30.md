# Continuing from 30 because 18-29 were too messy.
I tried to rush this and get the MVP out and published overnight and I simply wrote a lot of half-finished prompts with lots of followup requests. At some point i might just copy them all over here, but for now, we continue building!

## Bug fixes and webgpu porting
I had asked gpt 4.1 (free in vscode copilot) to switch to webgpu, this has caused quite a few subtle and small bugs and some things are incompatible (axeshelper, postprocessing from r3f)

This prompt is quite horizontal as there are multiple 

## Prompt
Problem: A couple things have to be changed in the editor to make it threejs/webgpu compatible
Expected: Every feature works as expected
Affected Features:
 - In Edit Mode, Face mode is not working, when i click on faces it fails with Vertex range (first: 0, count: 3) requires a larger buffer (36) than the bound buffer size (0) of the vertex buffer at slot 0 with stride 12.
 While encoding [RenderPassEncoder (unlabeled)].Draw(3, 1, 0, 0).
 While finishing [CommandEncoder "renderContext_0"].

 - In Vertex mode, when i select a vertex, it moves out of position, to 0,0,0 and becomes a large yellow vertex (it used to stay same size, position and just turn yellow)

 - Briefly scan through the codebase and check for any irregularities you can find other than the mentioned ones that are incompatible with webgpu

 - The Loop Cut tool at some point broke, it works initially once, however the preview lines are messed up (i assume webgpu), and if ANY object is added, deleted, moved, scaled, or anything really, the loop cutter no longer works at all (it shows previews but no cuts happen anymore), happens with ALL objects in the scene even if another was changed and this one is untouched
