# Followup on TSL nodes
Nothing special, unstructured prompt telling it to continue the work on tsl nodes

## Prompt

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language

Read up on tsl if you don't know it already, then continue building the different nodes and categories in my shader editor

I do not have any strategy for file uploads/textures yet, so leave these out for now

Read up on tsl if you don't know it already, then continue building the different nodes and categories in my shader editor

I do not have any strategy for file uploads/textures yet, so leave these out for now

GitHub Copilot: I'll scan the shader editor and TSL-related code to see what's already implemented and what new nodes/categories we should add next. I'll read the shader types to understand how nodes are defined and how the editor expects categories, inputs, and outputs to be described. I'll search for the shader editor store or any menu/category configuration to wire new nodes into the palette. Batching file updates to add many new TSL node categories (conditionals, camera, screen/viewport, UV utils, interpolation, random, rotate, reflect/optics, blend, packing) by extending `ShaderNodeType`, `NodeInputs/Outputs`, and implementing corresponding resolvers. After this batch, I’ll checkpoint and validate types.

I’ll add the missing resolver files for each new category, implementing minimal mappings to three/tsl functions and leaving out any texture-dependent functionality.

Summarized conversation historyI'll scan the code to locate the TSL imports causing attempted import errors and adjust them to the correct API for the installed three version.

I’ll get your shader editor into a clean build state by fixing the TSL import issues and then report status and next steps.

## actions taken

- Built the app to validate new node modules.
- Saw attempted import errors from TSL symbols not available in three 0.179.
- Updated TSL resolvers to use version-compatible symbols:
  - In attr-nodes.ts: removed unsupported `position`, `cameraViewPosition`, `viewPosition` fallbacks; now prefer `positionLocal`, `normalLocal`, and fall back to `modelViewPosition` for view-space.
  - In osc-nodes.ts: replaced `highPrecisionModelViewMatrix` with `modelViewMatrix`.
- Rebuilt to confirm.

## status

- Build: PASS. App compiles successfully.
- Lint/typecheck: Only warnings remain (lots of anys and missing hook deps; no blockers).
- The earlier “Cannot find module”/attempted import errors are resolved.

## what’s next

- Smoke-test in the editor: add a few of the newly added nodes (e.g., camera → remap → blend) and ensure materials compile at runtime.
- If you want, I can start the dev server and quickly verify a couple of node chains and adjust any resolver edge cases found.

## quality gates

- Build: PASS
- Lint/Typecheck: WARN (non-blocking)
- Unit tests: none present

## requirements coverage

- Add TSL nodes/categories, excluding textures: Done
- Keep project building: Done
- Resolve missing-module/import issues: Done

alightinastorm: make the context menu smaller in max height and scrollable, same for the submenu

it's showing it out of screen because its so big

GitHub Copilot: I’ll search for the shader editor context menu component to update its max-height and overflow styles for both root and submenus. 
```

I’ll cap the menu heights and enable scrolling so the root and submenus don’t run off-screen.

## changes made
- Root context menu (shader-editor.tsx):
  - Applied max height and vertical scroll to the popup container.
  - Class change: added max-h-[60vh] overflow-y-auto overscroll-contain.
- Submenus (shader-context-menu.tsx):
  - Applied the same max height and scroll to each submenu panel.
  - Class change in SubMenu: max-h-[60vh] overflow-y-auto overscroll-contain.
  - Wrapped content in a scrollable container to avoid overflow when many sections are expanded.

## files touched
- shader-editor.tsx:
  - ContextMenu.Popup now: className="... min-w-48 max-h-[60vh] overflow-y-auto overscroll-contain ..."
- shader-context-menu.tsx:
  - SubMenu container now: className="... max-h-[60vh] overflow-y-auto overscroll-contain ..."
  - Root wrapper now scrollable: className="relative max-h-[60vh] overflow-y-auto overscroll-contain"

## status
- Build: PASS
- Behavior: Menus are constrained to 60vh and become scrollable when content exceeds that height.

If you want a different limit, say 50vh or a fixed pixel height, I can adjust quickly. If submenus need to flip to the left when near the right edge, I can add edge-detection next.
