# Performance run
Okay we got sculpting working, crazy
But it's super slow and my guess is that this is because it's running all these algorithms, updating the store, rerendering, in a loop while using the brush. 

## Prompt

Task: Implement an efficient local state based rendering for edit mode.

Current Architecture: Currently tools on edit mode modify directly the store and read directly from the store.
Pain Points: This is nice and easy for things like moving a single vertex but it is very inefficient for complex operations such as the Sculpting tools, like inflate etc. 

Instead tools should work on the local copy, fast rerenderings and only once a tools operation finishes it should commit to the store.
