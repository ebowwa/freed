# This time we venture out and experiment with modifiers
From my unprofessional understanding, modifiers get access to the raw topology and can do.. whatever they want in a sequential pipeline - however this is only happening on render, but never actually modifying the object itself. Let's test it?

## Prompt
Task: Build a robust modifier system for objects. Start with the ones i list below.
User Interactions:
 - users can add, rearrange and tweak settings of each modifier they add to an object
 - modifiers can be toggled view an eye icon (show/hide (which means apply/dont apply))
 - modifier settings are directly reflected in the viewport
 - users can "apply" modifiers, which means that modifier actually changes the underlying object fully and disappears from the modifiers list

State Management:
 - use the zustand stores for everythign as much as possible!

Rendering:
 - modifiers, unless "applied" are only applied at the render stage, it fetches the modifier pipeline of an object and sequentially applies it (without changing the raw object in the store!)
 - modifiers that are hidden aren't run in the pipeline

Notes:
 - make it similar to blender pls, and keep performance in mind and don't you dare breaking my edit mode!
 - also stay within the clean, dark, soothing calm UI of the other panels
