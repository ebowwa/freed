# What happened to 62-89?
If you're reading this at some point in the future, well the short answer is i got lazy. The long answer is that I was exploring many horizontal prompt techniques which may or may not have been useful and most of them were written late at night and i often fell asleep while prompting and kept telling myself that i'll eventually add them later here.
I didn't, so deal with it i guess.

## Prompt

Task: Generate a node-based terrain system.
User Interactions:
 - Users can open / close a terrain editor from the inspector panel when a terrain object is selected
 - In the Terrain Editor, they can add nodes which always have at least an input and output to chain them
 - Nodes may have inputs inside them, such as numerical values or toggles
 - Users generate procedural deterministic terrain with the node system
 - EVERY generative node has a seed to it (which is uniquely generated the first time the node is added)
 - The nodes will have many different categories and there will be dozens of nodes, such as primitives, geo primitives, profie, filters, erosions, water, snow, etc.
 - Users can set general settings of the terrain system in the apps inspector panel.
 - General settings include:
  * Material (using the current material shader system just like regular objects!!)
  * Vertex resolution (the actual underlying buffer vertices)
  * Texture resolution (see explanation below)
  * Width
  * Height
 - The system itself should still be affected by the transform properties of objects (rotation, scale, position)

 Interface:
  - Keep it in my minimalistic monotonic dark soothing interface. do not add any colorful elements.

State Management:
 - All nodes and the object itself MUST be stored in the geometry-store, same way like regular geometries and shader system
 - You may use a terrain-editor-store for editor related state

Rendering:
 - Respect the wireframe/solid/material shading modes
 - To allow for incredibly detailed geometry without using tooooo many vertices, use clever techniques with texture maps like procedural normal maps to produce highly realistic terrain
 - These terrain textures are ALWAYS applied (unless in wireframe mode), and the objects material is additionally added to the renderer, so it has two materials in it if users add a custom material, but in any case that texture stuff needs to always be included!

Notes:
 - I already have a working react-flow based shader editor,
